We have used the fstream library which provides C++ programmers with three classes for working with files. These classes include:

ofstream– This class represents an output stream. It’s used for creating files and writing information to files.

ifstream– This class represents an input stream. It’s used for reading information from data files.

fstream– This class generally represents a file stream. It comes with ofstream/ifstream capabilities. This means it’s capable of creating files, writing to files, reading from data files.

ios:: app	The Append mode. The output sent to the file is appended to it.

ios::in	It opens the file for a read.

ios::out	It opens the file for a write.
